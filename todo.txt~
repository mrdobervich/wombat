notes:
- to prettyfiy code for a task in the long description, include a <code> </code> tag.  The view runs it through the addPrettifyTags() helper which dynamically replaces those with what google-code-prettyfiy expects, which is <pre class="prettify"> </pre>.



improvements:
- improve the skin for google-code-prettify
- right now we query the database for the list of task difficulties.
   Maybe it's better to have a defined constant somewhere for this.


bug fixes:
- right now tasks.js will prevent tabs from moving focus for textareas.  This probably happens for all textareas on the site and probably shouldn't.
