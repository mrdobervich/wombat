    <h3>Melody visualizer</h3>
    Here's a nice visualization of the baseline to a song: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At3OP5CvIRY">video</a>.  This looks like it could well have been made using processing.  The project is to find an easy way to produce this kind of visualization.  It should have a way to create a representation fo the notes to be vizualized, and a way to take that representation and produce the visualization.
